## Personal Website

## About
One of my active projects is the development of my personal website. As an actor; stand up comedian; and mixed martial artist, it would be beneficial and fun to develop my own website that introduce myself to the world. This will be a very fun project and I hope to design wesbites in the future. This site is currently under construction so please pardon our dust! 

Thank you for checking out my site!
